# SRMTH_Task4
The task is basically create a Graphic User Interface for editing pictures. There are four filters (created from scratch and 
without using any in built features and functions). They are :- 
1. Sobel Vertical
2. Sobel Horizontal
3. Laplacian Operation
4. Gaussian Blur

The user will be able to select any picture and the user is also given the privilege to click pictures then and there from 
the camera. Crop function will also be available to the user. When clicking the functions/buttons of the filters, the pictures 
will be shown with the filters applied.
